ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* README.md
* ic_launcher-web.png
* lib/
* lib/XposedBridgeAPI-89.jar
* pom.xml
* proguard-project.txt
* target/
* target/classes/
* target/classes/META-INF/
* target/classes/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/PayHelper/
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/PayHelper/PayHelper/
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/PayHelper/PayHelper/pom.properties
* target/classes/META-INF/maven/PayHelper/PayHelper/pom.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/jsoup-1.7.2.jar => app/libs/jsoup-1.7.2.jar
* libs/org.apache.http.legacy.jar => app/libs/org.apache.http.legacy.jar
* libs/xUtils-2.6.14.jar => app/libs/xUtils-2.6.14.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
